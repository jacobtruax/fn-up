      <p class="question">
        ST:How would you describe your work?
      </p>
      <p>
        AT: It’s immaterial. It’s always video or dance performance… text. Etc. I always start from a certain mood, a piece of music, maybe lonely, melancholic and I work from that mood to create a setting that I enjoy being in. I create from that. I would describe it as a kind of melancholic world or mood..
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        ST: What inspires you to create your work?
      </p>
      <p>
        AT: I was in South Korea for a few months a few years ago and that is when I started writing. I wrote a lot about what was happening. I was hanging out with all these tourists and American soldiers who were living there because of North Korea. They have all these soldiers who I started transcribing how they talked and what they talked about. There is something about that group dynamic and how they used their words which inspired me. These young male identities in groups, and how they’re trying to prove themselves in different ways.

            ST:Why do you think your work is important today?
          </p>
          <p>
            AT: I don’t know if it’s important. I guess these subjects have always existed. Maybe the media in itself, the 3D, animated, isolated space online is more common today. And the way of existing in an isolated place. But the stories have always existed, it’s just a modern setting.
          </p>
          <p class="question">
            ST: Why the choice of media? Why do you narrate through 3D renderings?
          </p>
          <p>
            AT: It was kind of close to what I was interested in. My first 3D work was doing this project called Hikori Mur (RET!!!). It was about people in Japan who locked themselves inside their rooms and don’t go outside at all and just sit being online in different spaces. I found this chatroom online where I got two know them a little, and they would send me pictures of their rooms or describe their rooms looked. I took those things and recreated their rooms in 3D. I exhibited their rooms naming them after their after their username etc. I guess it’s about doing your research and your actual work in this media. It’s seems so direct using your computer for that. Doing the actual project the way your doing your research. I was also always really interested in the 3D medium. It wasn’t an actual choice, it was more an interest in creating worlds.
          </p>
          <p class="question">
            ST: How do you choose your narratives?
          </p>
          <p>
            AT: It kind of happened by itself. I started writing and the people around me who would talk about what I started writing down. And then I mixed it with text to create the artwork. But when I first started writing I wasn’t aware about what I was writing about and then later I discovered that it was same thematic in all my videos. I’m trying to start about serious stuff, but also in a humorous way. It’s about youth, identity and fitting in as a male. I don’t want it to be judging or talking down to people. I think the characters talk a lot of shit but they also talk some truth in between. Or there is a lot of truth in the shit. A lot of vulnerability but also not.

          <p class="question">
            ST: How would you like your work to be perceived by your audience?
          </p>
          <p>
            AT: I think it’s out of my hands. I want the setting to be good, I want it to be an isolated space. I want it to be a dark room where you can just sit and just look at the video. That’s why I have a hard time exhibiting it in galleries with daylight, where you don’t know when it’s going to loop and you’re not there from the beginning and there are people talking around etc. I want it to be like you’re watching it on your screen alone. And then people can see it as they want to. Hopefully they will think it’s fun and kind of sad as well.

              ST: Where do you see your work going in the future?
            </p>
            <p>
              AT: Longer stories. Most of the things I Have done so far have been mostly 10 min. So I want it to be an hour or two things. And I want it to be more narrative work. I have been trying to write a book. And I have a really hard time with it. I can make nice scenes, but putting the scenes together is really hard and make sense of it and making them work together, creating an actual story that people will enjoy for a long time. That is kind of the goal. I also want to keep making videos for the internet, but for exhibitions, I think it would be really nice to be there and see it how people react to it. So when it comes to exhibiting I want to do more performance work, where I am actually there as a person. I think with gallery spaces are really spaces where people often come and go, but when it’s a performance people actually stay and then you can see how they react and talk to them after. It’s a better climax of finishing your work than just leaving your stuff on the floor.

            <p class="question">
              ST: How do you think technology is affecting our society today?
            </p>
            <p>
              AT: I think of course it affects us a lot, but I don’t really feel that everything is changing quickly. I have a hard time seeing it from the outside. I myself have uninstalled a ton of the apps on my phone, so I don’t get any notifications. And in that way I have isolated myself, at least from the social media part of technology. Because I think that makes me more productive. But I also think that it doesn’t always have to be that way. Maybe I just need to learn how to be productive with all the notifications happening.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              ST: And how will affect our society in the near future?
            </p>
            <p>
              AT: They already have lessons in school where they have computer technology/programming from an early age. I think we as well are becoming more aware of our data and laws. EU just put up a new law restricting companies from stealing data without paying. And what is needed is that the law system also starts working on the internet and we become aware of fake news etc. In this way I think we are going to be aware in general. And I do believe we going to be really good at controlling all of this. In general I am really positive for the future. I think we will figure it out.
